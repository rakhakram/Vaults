# Contribution guidlines

Contributions are very welcome! If you've got a theme, plugin, tool, CSS snippet or anything exciting related to Obsidian that you want included in this list, you're welcome to submit a PR.

All PRs are manually reviewed, so don't fret if your submission is not merged at once. To aid the maintainers and have your PR approved more quickly, go over this checklist:

- Abide by the already established style of the list.
  
  - If you addition is part of a table, make sure it is correctly formatted.
  - If the section has a table of contents, update that as well.

- Make sure your addition is part of the correct section/category.
- Don't sneak in line. Append your addition to the **end** of the correct section. The ordering is handled by the maintainers. If you intentionally place yourself at the top, we will move you down to the bottom.
- If your addition is a CSS snippet, make sure that the CSS file is named fittingly, and that you include an example image in the README.

As long as you follow these guidelines, you will probably get merged. If anything is unclear, just submit a draft PR, and we can discuss how to progress from there :smile:
